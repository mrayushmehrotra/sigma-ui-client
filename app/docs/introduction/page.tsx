            This is not a component library. It is how you build your component
            library.
          </h2>
          <p>
            You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install
            a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.
            <br />
            <br />
            This approach works well until you need to customize a component to
            fit your design system or require one that isnâ€™t included in the
            library.{" "}
            <b>
              Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds
              to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries
              with incompatible APIs.
            </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            This is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the
            following principles:
            <ul className="m-2 list-disc ">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <b>Open Code: </b>The Top layer of your component code is open
                for modifications
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <b>Composition: </b>
                every component uses a common, composable interface, making it
                easily predicatable
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Superset: </b>
                this is a superset of shadcn/ui which is built on top of shadcn,
                which mean&apos;s some component might use shadcn behind the
                scene
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
